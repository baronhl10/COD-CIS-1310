        <p>Advancements in technology have been the driving force behind space exploration. Modern telescopes, like the James Webb Space Telescope, allow us to observe distant galaxies and exoplanets, while robotic missions, such as the Mars rovers, provide valuable data about other planets. Innovations in propulsion systems, materials science, and artificial intelligence continue to push the boundaries of what is possible, making interstellar travel a future possibility.</p>

        <p>Space exploration began in earnest during the mid-20th century, marked by the launch of the first artificial satellite, Sputnik 1, by the Soviet Union in 1957. This event ignited the Space Race between the United States and the Soviet Union, leading to groundbreaking achievements like the first human in space, Yuri Gagarin, in 1961, and the Apollo 11 moon landing in 1969. These milestones not only demonstrated human ingenuity but also opened the door to understanding our place in the universe.</p>
